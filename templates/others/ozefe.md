        <dd>SCP-2667 is a garden in France containing nine red clay statues of young women. Every day for a short period in the early afternoon, these statues become active, allowing people within ten meters to hear a voice speaking French, regardless of their own language. These voices claim to be tourists visiting Earth through the statues, which act as "platforms" for viewing the planet, and are guided by an unseen entity. One broken statue, SCP-2667-10, is believed to be a tourist who could not leave in time after the platform was damaged.</dd>

        <dd>Festivus is a secular holiday celebrated annually on December 23rd, conceived by author Daniel O'Keefe and popularized by the 1997 *Seinfeld* episode "The Strike" co-written by his son, Dan O'Keefe. It serves as an alternative to the commercialism and pressures of the Christmas season. Key traditions, as depicted in *Seinfeld*, include displaying an unadorned aluminum pole instead of a Christmas tree, a Festivus dinner, the "airing of grievances" where participants express their disappointments with others, "feats of strength" which involve wrestling the head of the household, and the declaration of "Festivus miracles" for easily explainable events. While originally a quirky O'Keefe family tradition that involved nailing a clock in a bag to a wall, the *Seinfeld* episode introduced most of the widely recognized practices. The holiday has since been adopted by many, often as a form of playful consumer resistance or a non-religious celebration.</dd>
